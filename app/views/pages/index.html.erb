      Complaints about loss of crime and incident report trails at police stations will now be a thing of the past after
      the launch of Digital Police Occurrence Book.

      The Digital Occurrence Book operates in such a way that once a report has been made and entered, it cannot be
      altered.

      Speaking during the launch officiated by Cabinet Secretary Interior and Coordination of National Government
      Dr.Fred Matiangâ€™i at Buru buru Police station.

      Inspector General of Police Mr. Hilary Mutyambai said, since the system will be able to generate and analyse
      prevalent crime in each police station, proper case and crime management measures will be instituted to ensure
      effective and efficient service delivery.

      Mr. Mutyambai said, a total of 210 desk top computers have already been installed at Police Stations and Posts
      within Nairobi city County while 10,181 IPads have also been issued to Police officers in the city to ensure the
      effectiveness, efficiency and responsiveness while serving the members of the public.
